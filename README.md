# EMG-Signal-Processing-for-Muscle-Activity-Detection
MATLAB-based EMG signal processing to detect muscle activity using filtering, RMS, and thresholding.
Introduction
Electromyography (EMG) is used to measure electrical activity of skeletal muscles.
This project focuses on processing EMG signals using MATLAB to detect muscle activity.
Tools Used
- MATLAB
- Signal Processing Toolbox
Methodology
- EMG signal generation
- Bandpass filtering (20–450 Hz)
- Notch filtering
- Rectification
- RMS and threshold-based muscle activity detection
Output
- Detection of active and inactive muscle regions
- Count of muscle activity bursts
Applications
- Prosthetic control
- Rehabilitation monitoring
- Gesture recognition
- Sports performance analysis
